Imaginary Continent
The goal of imaginary continent is to provide a reasonable hypothesis for spatially discrete climate zones defined by temperature and precipitation using only a user-defined map of geographic features with land, water, mountains, and wind.

Latitude/Longitude of Nearest Major Mountain Range
	-> relative position
		- orographic lifting
		- elevation

Latitude/Longitude of Nearest Major Body of Water
	-> relative position

Prevailing wind direction(s); upper and lower
	-> convergence/divergence
	-> relation to mountains/bodies of water
